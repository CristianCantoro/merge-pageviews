To merge the data for a single day, assuming that:
* you have downloaded the pagecounts files `pagecounts-20071210-*.gz` to your
  local folder `data/input/sorted_time/2007-12/`;
* you want to save the output in a directory called `output`;
* you want to merge the pageviews for `2007-12-10`;

you can launch the script like this:
```bash
./import_pageviews_sorted_by_time_spark.py \
    --datadir data/input/sorted_time/2007-12/ \
    --outputdir output \
    20071210
