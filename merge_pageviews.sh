# Counts format: only hours with page view count > 0 (or data missing) are represented,
#
# Hour 0..23 shown as A..X (saves up to 22 bytes per line compared to comma separated values), followed by view count.
# If data are missing for some hour (file missing or corrupt) a question mark (?) is shown,
# and a adjusted daily total is extrapolated as follows: for each missing hour the total is incremented with hourly average
#
# Page titles are shown unmodified (preserves sort sequence)
